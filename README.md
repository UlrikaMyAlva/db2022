# Db2022
Normalization of a database as a school project at ITHS. In this repository your will find a script to normalize a database, a ER model to show the relationships in the normalized data and a JBDC CRUD.  


To make this diagram we have used Mermaid, which is a tool to be able to draw a diagram using markdown language.   


# ER diagram  


In the original table, everything where together with a column each. To normalize it each subject has gotten their own column. StudentId is used as a key in most of the tables, except School and Hobby that is linked to the StudentId via tables StudentSchool and StudentHobby.
